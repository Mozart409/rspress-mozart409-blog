# Setting Up Prometheus with Docker Compose for Local Development

When developing applications, monitoring performance metrics is crucial for identifying bottlenecks, ensuring reliability, and optimizing resource usage. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for this purpose. This blog post will guide you through setting up Prometheus for local development using Docker Compose.

### Why Use Prometheus Locally?
Using Prometheus locally allows developers to:

- Quickly identify performance issues in real-time.
- Test alerts and monitoring configurations before deploying to production.
- Understand how applications behave under different conditions or loads.

### 1. Create a docker-compose.yml file

:::info

When running your application on your development machine outside of Docker, use `network_mode: host` to ensure Docker containers can communicate with services on your host machine.

:::

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3.7'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host # use host network to access the host machine
    ports:
      - '9090:9090'
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

### 2. Create a prometheus.yml file

Create a prometheus.yml file to define how Prometheus should scrape metrics:

```yaml title="prometheus.yml"
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'app'

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'backend'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3001'] # Metrics endpoint of the frontend application
        labels:
          group: 'app'
```

### Explanation:

- scrape_interval - Defines how frequently Prometheus checks for metrics.
- external_labels - Adds labels to all metrics for easy filtering.
- scrape_configs - Defines which targets Prometheus should scrape metrics from.
