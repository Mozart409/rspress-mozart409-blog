# Prometheus Docker Compose

## How to setup prometheus for you local development

### 1. Create a docker-compose.yml file

:::info

If your application is running on your development machine natively, you must use the `network_mode: host` to access the docker container on the host machine.

:::

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3.7'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host # use host network to access the host machine
    ports:
      - '9090:9090'
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

### 2. Create a prometheus.yml file

```yaml title="prometheus.yml"
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'app'

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'backend'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3001'] # Metrics endpoint of the frontend application
        labels:
          group: 'app'
```
