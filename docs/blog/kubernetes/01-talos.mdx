# 01 - Talos Linux

This is my journey about my home lab setup with talos linux. At my day job we run it as well.

## Expectations

- Run a multi node kubernetes cluster with stateful and stateless applications.
- Access my homelab from my mobile devices.
- Backup dbs to an S3 compatible storage provider.

## Techstack

- [Talos](https://talos.dev/docs)
- Kubernetes
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) or [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
- [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) as CNI
- [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) as CSI, at work we use Longhorn, but at home I want to try it out
- [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/), at work we use [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and we are very happy, but at home I want to try something else

## Network

My current simplified home network.

<br />

- My Router only connects to my ISP.
- PiHole handles DHCP and dns blocking.
- My Proxmox instance is my old desktop pc which connects to my unifi switch.
- The Unifi Wifi hotspot handles multiple wireless networks, one for work, IoT devices and private devices.
